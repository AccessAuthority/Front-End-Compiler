# Front-End-Compiler
 Frontend compilation translates human-readable code (HTML, CSS, JS) into machine-readable format, optimizing for browsers. It speeds up loading, ensures cross-browser compatibility, and enhances user experiences. Integrating tools like Babel for JS transpilation and Sass for CSS preprocessing, it automates tasks, streamlining development.
